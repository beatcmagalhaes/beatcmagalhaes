# 👋 Welcome to my scientific portfolio!
Here, I try to explore the intersection between biotechnology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics (it's in construction!)

## 👩‍🔬 About Me
Hi! I’m **Beatriz Magalhães**, a researcher with a background in **Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology**, currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics** at the *School of Health Sciences – Polytechnic of Porto (Portugal)*.

I’m passionate about combining **molecular biology**, **statistics**, and **data science** to explore meaningful biological patterns — from gene expression to health and environmental datasets.

My academic path has given me hands-on experience in **molecular genetics**, **cytogenetics**, and **microbiological research**, while my current studies strengthen my skills in **bioinformatics**, **data analytics**, and **computational biology**.
